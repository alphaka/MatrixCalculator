# MatrixCalculator
Matrix L,U Factorization, Reduced Row-Echelon, and basis calculator

•	Develop a program that intake a 3x3 matrix, and calculate the U, L factors. The program check whether or not a factor to matrix exists first.
•	The program finds the reduced row-echelon form of the input matrix as well
